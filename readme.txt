== Description ==
Designed for easy display, editing, & scheduling of lunch menus or other similar lists, TM Lunch Menu uses a custom widget to display your menu on any page of your site. This plugin allows you to easily add a daily menu by simply filling in the meal for any day (and any number of days) of the week, set a menu start date and hit publish. Once published it will automatically show up in the custom "Lunch Menu" widget when its time comes. After a menu (or menu item) has expired it will automatically remove itself from the widget display. An integrated calendar style date-picker makes it even easier to select your menu's start date and the date is always shown next to every menu item so there is no confusion about what day the menu is for.
